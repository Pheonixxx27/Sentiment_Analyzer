# Sentiment_Analyzer
This project is focused on developing a tool which makes it easier for groups invested in sectors such as marketing, healthcare, politics to be able to gauge the public opinion with respect to any product or policy.
This is done by applying the concepts of Machine Learning to rate a particular word on as Positive, Negative or Neutral.
In order to provide better services to the general consumers it is important to take their sentiments into consideration.
